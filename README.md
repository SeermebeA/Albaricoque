Apricot is a camera-free perimeter node for gates, doors, and fences. It detects people within a 0-3 meter radius. It runs an AI model on an Arduino Nano 33 BLE Sense Rev2 and integrates four PIR sensors (HC-SR501) and three ultrasonic sensors (HC-SR04 15°/45°/75°). It sends telemetry via LoRa, and the prototype uses a 3D-printed housing.
